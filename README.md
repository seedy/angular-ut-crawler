# Prerequisites

- Node and npm
- Angular-Cli installed globally
- Angular 2+ project
- Project following Angular styleguide

# Usage
```
npm start
```

You will then be prompted to choose the relative path
to the file you want to test.

**Be careful** file paths are expected to start
from your project's root and follow a minimal folder architecture of
`src/app/`

# Development

Feel free to edit project files and handled types.

You can add extra behaviour through `/types` folder
which holds all logic by file type.

`index.js` holds the main logic and orchestrates calls.
